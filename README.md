# ltng-search

This is a Chrome extension for searching the [Lightning Component Library](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/overview/components) via Chrome.

Until I get it on the Web Store, install it by:

1. Going to Setup -> More Tools -> Extensions in Chrome
2. Check "Developer Mode" to on
3. Clone this repo 
4. Click "Load Unpacked" from the Extensions manager
5. Select the folder of the repo
6. Enjoy

To use it, type "ltng" in the omnibox/url bar and hit tab or space.  Then type the full name of the component/interface/event you want to search.  A la:

* ltng lightning:recordForm
* ltng force:hasRecordId
* ltng aura:systemError

And it will pull up the URL of that component/interface/event in the library.
